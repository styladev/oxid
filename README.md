# Styla Oxid Plugin

This plugin provides the magazine functionality to your oxid shop. It accepts all requests on the configurated base directory and generate a dynamic response that includes the shop template containing the magazine JavaScript snippet (that canâ€™t usually be crawled by search engines) and the crawlable content including meta information. Additional it provides a product feed to use your own products in the styla editor.

## Requirements

OXID version 5.1 or later

1. Copy the contents of *copy_to_modules* into the *modules* directory on your OXID installation.

3. Configurate your styla username (provided by your account manager) in the Styla plugin:
![Configure Username](/readme/readme_styla_username.png)

4. Enable product api and configurate a random string (should be between 6 and 30 characters) as api key in the Styla Feed plugin (please send this to your account manager - so we can enable your products in the styla editor):

### Please do not create any subpages in your CMS or directories for your magazine. The plugin itself will take care of setting up the /magazine/ (or any other) page on which the magazine will appear and of the roouting as well.

### Important if updating to V1.5.0 or later

If a previous version of the plugin (both modules) is already installed then you should stick to the following sequence when installing the 1.5 update:

1. Install the new module
2. Activate the new module
3. Enter the settings from the previous version
4. Check the 'Enable Product API' box (screenshot above)
5. Deactivate the old modules
6. Uninstall the old modules.

If you go through these steps in a different sequence, this might lead to problems.
